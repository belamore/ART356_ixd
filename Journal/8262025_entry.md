#CH1 of DOET

I think Chapter 1 does a good job of provoking the reader to think about their own experiences of designs they’ve encountered and felt challenged by, especially when the author presents anecdotes of design errors and guides the reader through them. I think the most interesting aspect of this topic is that numerous design errors may seem insignificant on the surface, but are actually very significant in reality; the lack of feedback in a design is something that comes to mind in this regard. I don’t think many people, including myself, tend to think deeply about what makes a design work and what doesn’t. However, after having read this chapter the first time about 2 years ago, I started to be a bit more mindful regarding designs around me, which was an interesting change. I think one of my favorite examples mentioned in this chapter is the mapping for a car, because it still holds up very well and offers the reader a better understanding of the logic behind certain design choices; meanwhile, the telephone example from before serves as an example where the mappings are seemingly nonsensical. Overall, after reading this chapter again, I found it was a good refresher for terminology that I tend to hear pretty often.
